**Sea Urchins**

During my junior and senior year I was the project lead for a team of three other undergraduate students doing research on the green sea urchin (*Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis*). We were researching economically feasible methods of rearing urchins in offshore macroalgal and bivalve aquaculture sites. Once the urchins were of an appropriate size they would be outcropped to the ocean lease site of the aquaculture facilities. We studies larval rearing, nutrition, and behavior. Both years resulted in a publication. The first puplication was written for New Hampshire Sea Grant. The second publication is still in the review process.



**Larval Studies**

Our larval studies consisted of artificial spawning and then rearing larvae in beakers. We would then monitor and feed them. The end goal was to be able to raise them through metamorphosis but this is difficult to do as they are very fragile as larvae.



**Nutritional Studies**

Nutritional studies consisted of comparing their natural food (kelp and animal protein) to invasive macroalgae and a premade artificial wafer. Urchins are very picky on the type of macroalgae they eat and due to their physiology they have specific requirements as to the consistancy of their food.



**Behavioral Study**

As urchins typically prefer to hide in crevices and pick up small bits of debris or macroalgae to hide themselves we were curious if they had a preference for material. We studied the preference between bits of shell, which would be constant, and kelp, which could be also utilized as food.
